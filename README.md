# CryptoClustering
Unsupervised Learning Crypto Analysis

This is an analysis of Cryptocurrency data using KMeans.  I created an elbow curve to create the optimal number of clusters for the analysis, and then performed that analysis to visualize the clusters on a scatterplot.  This was then repeated using Principal Component Analysis to compare the effect it had on reducing the dimensionality of the data.  The two processes are compared and contrasted at the end of the code.
