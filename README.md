This is an analysis of Cryptocurrency data using KMeans.  I created an elbow curve to create the optimal number of clusters for the analysis, and then performed that analysis to visualize the clusters on a scatterplot.  This was then repeated using Principal Component Analysis to compare the effect it had on reducing the dimensionality of the data.
